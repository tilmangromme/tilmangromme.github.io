Hello everyone, my name is Tilman Gromme and I will be blogging about the process of software development by providing regular updates about the current projects I am working on. Here I will detail all aspects of the process including high level design and implementation. I will also detail my design philosophy and provide a basis for the decisions made during my projects. My first project will be the creation of a supply planning solver. This will be an enterprise tool used by businesses to manage and optimize their material aquisition process and other similar operations. This software will include all features necessary to make this a viable product for businesses to use in their operations.
